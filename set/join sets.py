""" Python - Join Sets """


""" Join Two Sets """
'''
There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.
You can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets, 
or the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another:
'''

print("----------------------------------------------")
# The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets:

set1={'a','b','c'}
set2={1,2,3,4,5}
set3=set1.union(set2)
print("set3 :",set3)

print("----------------------------------------------")
# The update() method inserts the items in set2 into set1:

set1.update(set2)
print("set1 :",set1)

# Note: Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.



print("----------------------------------------------")
""" Keep ONLY the Duplicates """


# The intersection_update() method will keep only the items that are present in both sets.
# Keep the items that exist in both set x, and set y:
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
x.intersection_update(y)
print(x)


print("----------------------------------------------")
# The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print("x :",x)
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
print("y :",y)
z = x.intersection(y)
print("z :",z)


print("----------------------------------------------")
""" Keep All, But NOT the Duplicates """
# The symmetric_difference_update() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
x.symmetric_difference_update(y)
print(x)



print("----------------------------------------------")
# The symmetric_difference() method will return a new set, that contains only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
z = x.symmetric_difference(y)
print(z)
